This is the README for the ArduinoLIDAR project.

The end goal of this project is to create a working LIDAR set up with Arduino and an ultrasonic sensor.

Project Checkpoints:

1. Find out how to connect and read data from an ultrasonic sensor on a microcontroller board (RPi, Arduino, ESP32)
2. Create a graph of ultrasonic sensor data.
3. Create a 2d graph of ultrasonic sensor data points around the ultrasonic sensor (in cm, use points as a way to map on graph)
4. Build a platform for the ultrasonic sensor that is connected to a motor that can turn 360 degrees.
5. Sync ultrasonic sensor polling rate with motor, so that data can be easier to process. (ex: 50cm from sensor, 25 degrees from center)
6. Build a stand with the ultrasonic sensor at 4 feet tall. (1/2 room height) 
7. Successfully test the build so that the sensor maps out a 2d slice of the test room on a graph.
